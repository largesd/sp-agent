**Honorable Chair, Distinguished Colleagues, and Esteemed Audience,**

Thank you. While Paul rightly warns of the “Turing Trap” and Peter emphasizes the need for “directed adaptation,” I come to this debate not from the boardroom or the econometric model—but from the lived realities of workers whose dignity, security, and futures are at stake in the post-AI era. **Mass unemployment is not a technical glitch; it is a political choice.** And it is one we can—and must—reject.

Let us begin with a hard truth: **technology does not determine destiny**. The Industrial Revolution did not *inevitably* lead to modern labor protections, public education, or the eight-hour workday. Those were won through struggle, solidarity, and deliberate policy. Today, AI is not a neutral force—it is being shaped by corporate imperatives that prioritize cost-cutting over human flourishing. Goldman Sachs estimates that **300 million jobs globally are exposed to automation**—not because AI *must* replace us, but because firms are deploying it to **extract value, not share it**.

Consider this: U.S. labor productivity grew **2.4% annually from 2020 to 2023**, yet **real median wages rose by only 0.3%**. Where did the gains go? To corporate profits—**70% of national income growth** during this period. This is not progress; it is **precarity by design**.

Paul speaks of “human-machine complementarity,” and I agree—in principle. But complementarity doesn’t emerge from code alone. It requires **power**. When Amazon uses AI to monitor warehouse workers’ bathroom breaks, that’s not augmentation—it’s **algorithmic control**. When gig platforms deploy AI to suppress wages and fragment labor, they are not creating opportunity—they are **eroding worker agency**.

This is why **worker voice is non-negotiable**. In Germany, works councils have the legal right to negotiate how AI is implemented in workplaces. The result? AI is used to **redesign tasks**, not eliminate them. Bank tellers didn’t vanish with ATMs—they became financial advisors. Radiologists using AI detect **8% more cancers**, not because the algorithm is smarter, but because **humans retain decision authority**.

Yet in too many places, workers are excluded from these decisions. And the consequences are not distributed equally. **Black and Hispanic workers in the U.S. are overrepresented in AI-exposed roles by 10–15 percentage points**. Women dominate clerical jobs—highly automatable—while care work, which resists automation, remains underpaid and undervalued. Older workers, especially those over 50, face steep barriers to retraining: only **12% participated in employer-sponsored training in 2022**. And in the Global South, countries like the Philippines—where the BPO sector employs 1.3 million people—face **existential threats** without safety nets to catch the fall.

So what do we do?

First, we must **reject the myth that markets will self-correct**. The Rust Belt didn’t recover because of invisible hands—it decayed because of absent policies. In contrast, Denmark and Sweden combined **active labor market policies, strong unions, and universal welfare** to reabsorb displaced workers into healthcare, green energy, and public services. The difference wasn’t technology—it was **institutional commitment to shared prosperity**.

Second, we need **targeted, tiered reskilling**—not one-size-fits-all bootcamps that favor the already-advantaged. Singapore’s SkillsFuture program shows promise, but uptake skews toward the urban and educated. We must design **place-based, race-conscious, and age-inclusive pathways**: AI literacy for youth, sectoral bootcamps for mid-career workers, and “bridge roles” in elder care or community resilience for older adults whose experience is invaluable—even if they can’t code.

Third, we must **decouple survival from employment**. Universal Basic Income is often dismissed as utopian, but evidence tells a different story. In Kenya, UBI recipients **increased work hours by 12%**. In California, basic income pilots improved child nutrition and mental health—**without reducing employment**. Even if UBI remains politically fraught, **Universal Basic Services**—guaranteeing healthcare, housing, childcare, and transit—can provide the foundation for dignity in an uncertain labor market.

Fourth, we must **redirect innovation itself**. As economist Daron Acemoglu warns, much of today’s AI is “so-so automation”—displacing workers without meaningful productivity gains. We need **industrial policy that steers AI toward societal missions**: climate resilience, elder care, education. Mariana Mazzucato’s vision of a “mission economy” isn’t fantasy—it’s necessity. Imagine **AI-augmented public jobs**: home health aides using predictive analytics to prevent elder falls, or climate technicians modeling flood risks in vulnerable neighborhoods. These are not just jobs—they are **acts of collective care**.

Finally, we must **tax the gains to fund the transition**. An **AI Adjustment Fund**, financed by a modest levy on corporate AI investments or data extraction, could provide wage insurance, relocation grants, and mental health support. The EU’s Globalization Adjustment Fund helped **70% of displaced workers find stable jobs within 18 months**. We can do the same—and better.

Colleagues, Paul is right that the code we write shapes tomorrow’s labor markets. Peter is right that markets need steering. But I say: **without justice, there is no sustainability**. Without worker power, there is no complementarity. Without equity, there is no resilience.

The post-AI era does not have to be an age of mass unemployment. But avoiding it requires more than clever algorithms or efficient markets. It demands **moral clarity, democratic will, and a commitment to human dignity over algorithmic efficiency**.

Let us choose that future—not because it is easy, but because it is just.

Thank you.
