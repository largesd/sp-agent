# Peter's Speech - Round 1

**Honorable Chair, Distinguished Colleagues, and Esteemed Audience,**

I stand before you today not as a technological determinist nor as a social revolutionary, but as an economist and policy maker who believes that **institutions, incentives, and intelligent design of transition policies will determine whether AI becomes our greatest productivity breakthrough or our most devastating social disruption.**

Mary speaks powerfully about human dignity, and Paul correctly identifies the "Turing Trap" of substitution versus complementarity. Both perspectives are essential, but they miss the central economic reality: **markets alone will not solve this transition, but neither will well-intentioned policies that ignore market signals.** We need a third way—what I call "directed adaptation"—where we harness market forces while steering them toward socially optimal outcomes.

## The Economic Reality We Face

Let's begin with the data. My research shows that **30% of work activities in the U.S. economy could be automated by 2030**, affecting 73 million jobs. The World Economic Forum predicts AI will create 97 million new jobs but displace 85 million by 2025. These numbers aren't abstract—they represent the livelihoods of real people in data entry, administrative support, manufacturing, and retail customer service.

But here's what the raw statistics don't capture: **the temporal and geographic mismatch between job destruction and job creation.** When manufacturing automated in the early 2000s, the U.S. lost 5 million manufacturing jobs while productivity increased. The new jobs emerged eventually, but not in the same places, not requiring the same skills, and not on the same timeline. Workers in Ohio couldn't commute to software jobs in California, and 50-year-old factory workers couldn't easily become 25-year-old coders.

This is our fundamental challenge: **transition velocity.** Paul is right that displacement may happen in months while retraining takes years. My research shows reskilling an average displaced worker for medium-skill AI-complementary roles costs $24,000 and takes 9-18 months. Only 35% of displaced workers are willing to relocate for new jobs. We're facing not just occupational transitions but geographic and social transitions.

## Learning from What Works

History and international experience give us clear guides. Consider **Germany's Kurzarbeit system**, which subsidized reduced hours during the 2008 financial crisis, preventing mass layoffs. Companies kept skilled workers, workers maintained income, and when recovery came, Germany rebounded faster than economies that had shed human capital.

Or examine **South Korea's manufacturing transition** from 2010-2020. They lost 800,000 manufacturing jobs to automation but gained 1.2 million service jobs. How? Through sectoral bargaining—government, companies, and unions negotiating phased automation with two-year advance notice. They provided 70% wage replacement during retraining, and companies like Samsung ran dedicated reskilling centers with 80% job placement rates.

These successes point toward what I believe is our most promising framework: **Scandinavian Flexicurity Model 2.0**, combining flexible labor markets with generous social safety nets and active retraining policies.

## A Three-Tiered Policy Framework

Based on my research and economic analysis, I propose a tiered approach:

**First, immediate measures (0-2 years):**
We need **AI impact disclosure requirements**—mandating companies to report expected employment effects of major AI implementations. This creates transparency and allows proactive response. We should expand unemployment insurance into **transition insurance**, covering retraining periods with 80% wage replacement. And we must provide **emergency reskilling vouchers**—modeled after the successful GI Bill—giving workers in high-risk occupations immediate resources to adapt.

**Second, medium-term restructuring (3-7 years):**
We should establish **sectoral transition councils**—industry-labor-government bodies to plan phased automation, modeled on Germany's "Future Councils." We need to reconsider **progressive automation taxation**—not to punish innovation but to fund transition. Bill Gates' proposal to tax companies using automation to fund retraining deserves serious consideration. And we must create **portable benefit accounts**, decoupling health, retirement, and training benefits from specific employers so workers can move between jobs without losing security.

**Third, long-term structural adaptation (8+ years):**
We must overhaul our education system, replacing degree-focused programs with **stackable micro-credentials** that allow continuous adaptation. We need mandatory AI literacy from K-12 through adult education, as Estonia has successfully implemented. And we should seriously explore **reduced workweek standards**—moving toward a 30-hour week without pay reduction, as productivity gains from AI make this economically feasible.

## Addressing Counter-Arguments

Some argue for Universal Basic Income as a solution. But Finland's UBI experiment showed employment effects were statistically insignificant, and a full UBI at poverty level would require doubling current U.S. tax revenues. UBI addresses symptoms, not causes, and risks reducing labor force participation precisely when we need engaged, adapting workers.

Others place excessive faith in retraining alone. But there's a "train for what?" problem—65% of children entering primary school will work in jobs that don't yet exist. Workers over 50 have 60% lower completion rates in tech retraining programs. And only 35% of companies investing in AI also invest significantly in worker retraining.

The answer isn't abandoning these tools but integrating them into a comprehensive system.

## The Path Forward

Mary is correct that technological unemployment is a social choice. Paul is correct that technology architecture matters. My economic perspective adds this: **We must design transition systems with the same innovation and rigor we apply to AI itself.**

We need policies that recognize AI transition isn't a single event but an ongoing process requiring permanent adaptation systems. We must balance innovation incentives with worker protection. We should focus on "predistribution"—equipping workers before displacement occurs—rather than just redistribution after damage is done.

The MIT Task Force on Work of the Future concludes that "the problem is not mass unemployment but mass quality downgrading." This is precisely why we need intelligent policy—to ensure the jobs AI creates are as good as or better than the jobs it displaces.

**In conclusion,** we stand at a historic inflection point. AI could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. The question is whether that wealth will concentrate or circulate, whether it will create anxiety or opportunity. As an economist, I tell you: markets need guardrails to serve society. As a policy maker, I tell you: those guardrails must be designed with economic literacy. Let us build a future where AI elevates human potential rather than replaces human purpose. Let us choose directed adaptation over destructive disruption.

Thank you.
