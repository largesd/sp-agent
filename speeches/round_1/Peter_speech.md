**Opening Statement: Embracing the AI Transition with Purpose and Preparation**

Good afternoon, esteemed colleagues, judges, and audience.

We stand at the precipice of the most significant economic transformation since the Industrial Revolution. The data from our research is unequivocal: the McKinsey Global Institute estimates 30% of current work hours could be automated by 2030, while the OECD warns 27% of jobs in member countries are at high risk. The Goldman Sachs projection of 300 million full-time jobs exposed globally is not a distant sci-fi scenario—it is our immediate policy horizon.

But let us be clear: this debate is not about whether AI will disrupt our labor markets. It will. The critical question is *how we choose to manage that disruption*. Will we be passive witnesses to a wave of displacement and social fracture, or will we be architects of a transition that harnesses AI’s immense productivity gains for shared prosperity? I argue we must choose the latter, and that requires a proactive, multi-pronged policy framework built on three pillars: **Investment in Human Capital, Modernization of our Social Contract, and Strategic Economic Steering.**

### **Pillar One: Invest in Human Capital with Unprecedented Scale and Specificity**

The historical precedent of the Industrial Revolution teaches us that transitions take decades and carry severe social costs if mismanaged. AI’s pace, however, is exponential. We cannot rely on generational change. Our response must be equally agile.

First, we must move beyond the outdated model of front-loaded education. The solution lies in institutionalizing **lifelong learning**. We should adopt and expand models like **Singapore’s SkillsFuture**, transforming it from simple training credits into comprehensive, individual **“Learning Portfolios”** that track and validate skills across a person’s entire career. This is not a luxury; it is a necessity for economic resilience.

Second, our training programs must be ruthlessly effective. The research from Round 2 is illuminating—and sobering. Generic “coding bootcamps” have a dismal 23% employment rate. What works? **Sectoral partnerships** that achieve 78% employment post-training. These are collaborations where employers, unions, and educators jointly design curricula for in-demand, AI-augmented roles. Look to the emerging fields: AI supervision in healthcare, compliance and cybersecurity in finance, robotics maintenance in manufacturing. The MIT Human-Centered AI Initiative’s framework is key here: redesign jobs so AI handles routine pattern recognition, freeing humans for exception handling, ethical judgment, and interpersonal connection—as seen in radiology, where AI triage allows more time for complex cases and patient care.

Furthermore, we must acknowledge demographic realities. The research shows workers over 50 require longer retraining but exhibit higher retention. We need **earn-and-learn apprenticeships** and **wage insurance schemes**, like the pilot in California, to make these transitions feasible without imposing catastrophic income loss. The German **Kurzarbeit** model, which combines short-time work subsidies with retraining, is proven cost-effective, costing €25,000 per worker retained versus €45,000 in unemployment and lost taxes.

### **Pillar Two: Modernize the Social Contract for an Agile Economy**

The 20th-century social contract—built on stable, lifelong employment with a single employer—is crumbling. Our policies must catch up. **Portable benefits** are non-negotiable. Health insurance, retirement contributions, and paid leave must be attached to the worker, not the job, providing security in a landscape of gig work, project-based roles, and multiple career transitions.

We must also strengthen our safety nets to act as **springboards, not hammocks**. Enhanced unemployment systems should have mandatory retraining components and support geographic mobility for workers moving from high-risk regions, like the 15 U.S. counties with over 40% of jobs at high automation risk identified by Brookings.

To those who suggest Universal Basic Income is a panacea, I urge caution. While it addresses basic consumption, the Round 1 research shows it risks creating dependency without solving for the profound human needs for purpose, social connection, and skill utilization. The Harvard study finding that fully displaced workers suffer **3x higher depression rates** than those in augmented roles, even with comparable income, tells us that **the quality and meaning of work matter intensely**. Our goal must be dignified participation, not mere sustenance.

### **Pillar Three: Steer the Economy with Intelligent Incentives and Investment**

The market alone will not produce an optimal outcome. There are clear market failures: short-term corporate incentives to automate without regard for social cost, geographic mismatches, and underinvestment in public goods. Policy must correct these.

We should seriously consider **productivity dividend sharing mechanisms**. This could take the form of an **Automation Impact Credit**, offering tax incentives to companies that retrain and redeploy workers rather than simply displace them. Proposals for **data dividends** or models akin to the **Alaska Permanent Fund**, where a share of the wealth generated by AI is distributed as a civic dividend, warrant robust debate and piloting.

Critically, we must use public investment to catalyze job creation in **human-complementary sectors**. As AI excels at cognitive and analytical tasks, the unique value of human empathy, creativity, and physical dexterity will rise. We should expand **Job Guarantee programs** in care work, education, the arts, and green infrastructure—fields that are socially essential, less automatable, and fulfill our need for purposeful work. The PwC analysis is correct: the core challenge is **distributional**. AI may boost GDP by 14-26%, but without intervention, that wealth will concentrate disastrously.

We must also learn from global comparatives. The **EU’s AI Act**, with its human oversight requirements and employment impact assessments, provides a regulatory framework for responsible deployment. China’s mandated “AI Trainer” roles show one approach to direct job creation within the transition. We can synthesize these insights.

### **Conclusion: A Call for Courageous Governance**

Colleagues, the research from both rounds presents a consistent message: the problem is not a lack of jobs in the aggregate, but the terrifying speed of displacement and the risk of devastating distributional inequality. The most promising path forward is an integrated model: the **flexicurity of Scandinavia** (robust safety nets with active labor market policies), the **sectoral partnerships of Germany**, and the **lifelong learning architecture of Singapore**, funded through a combination of reformed corporate taxation and a fair share of the AI productivity dividend.

This will require political courage and investment—estimated at 2-3% of GDP annually in the EU. But the cost of inaction is far greater: mass skill obsolescence, entrenched inequality, and a crisis of meaning that erodes the very fabric of our society.

Let us not be the generation that managed the rise of artificial intelligence by presiding over the decline of human dignity. Let us be the architects of a new bargain—one where technology elevates humanity, where productivity gains fund broader prosperity, and where our policy response is as innovative as the technology we seek to harness. The time to build that future is now.

Thank you.
