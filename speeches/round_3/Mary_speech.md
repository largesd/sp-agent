**Mary’s Closing Speech – Round 3**  
*Role: Sociologist / Labor Rights Advocate*

**Honorable Chair, Distinguished Colleagues, Esteemed Audience,**

Over these three rounds, Paul has rightly warned us of AI’s terrifying velocity—how it can hollow out expertise even while preserving paychecks. Peter has reminded us that markets, left to their own devices, distribute gains unjustly and pain unevenly. I stand before you not to contradict them, but to center what both risk overlooking: **the human beings behind the data points**—the clerical workers, the truck drivers, the BPO agents in Manila, the 55-year-old machinist in Ohio—whose dignity, livelihoods, and futures are being reshaped by algorithms they never designed and rarely control.

Let me be clear: **mass unemployment in the post-AI era is not inevitable—but neither is a just transition automatic.** History teaches us that technological change is never neutral. It reflects the values, power structures, and policy choices of those who shape it. The Industrial Revolution didn’t *naturally* lead to public education or the weekend; workers fought for those. The ATM didn’t *automatically* preserve bank teller jobs; it was workplace redesign and customer demand for human interaction that shifted roles toward relationship-building.

Today, we face a choice: Will AI deepen inequality, entrench precarious work, and erase entire occupational identities? Or will we harness it to build a more humane, equitable, and dignified economy?

The evidence is stark. Brookings (2024) shows that Black and Hispanic workers in the U.S. are **10–15 percentage points more likely** to hold AI-exposed jobs. In the Global South, up to **45% of routine cognitive tasks** could vanish by 2030—without the safety nets that cushioned transitions in Denmark or Germany. Meanwhile, U.S. productivity has surged, yet **70% of income growth flows to corporate profits**, not workers (Economic Policy Institute, 2023). This isn’t market failure—it’s policy abdication.

Paul speaks of “zombification”—of workers reduced to emotional janitors, cleaning up AI’s mistakes. I call it **algorithmic deskilling**, and it’s already here. In the Philippines, BPO workers once climbed ladders from Tier-1 to Tier-3 roles. Now, AI handles the technical queries, and humans are left to absorb customer rage—paid less, trained less, valued less. This isn’t augmentation; it’s **exploitation by interface**.

Peter offers “directed adaptation,” a compelling vision. But direction requires **steering mechanisms**—and right now, the wheel is in the hands of unaccountable tech firms. Without worker voice, without democratic oversight, “adaptation” becomes **imposition**.

So what do we do?

First, **we must reject the myth that reskilling alone is enough**. Yes, lifelong learning is essential—Singapore’s SkillsFuture shows promise. But when only 12% of workers over 55 access training (BLS, 2022), and rural communities lack broadband or training centers, we need **tiered, place-based, and equity-centered retraining**—not one-size-fits-all MOOCs.

Second, **we must decouple survival from employment**. A Universal Basic Income may seem radical, but pilots in Kenya and California show it **increases work, entrepreneurship, and well-being**—not idleness. Alternatively, Universal Basic Services—guaranteeing healthcare, childcare, housing, and transit—can reduce the existential terror of job loss. Either way, we must ensure that **no one is left destitute because an algorithm deemed their labor redundant**.

Third, **we must give workers power in the design of AI itself**. Germany’s works councils don’t just consult—they co-determine how technology is implemented. We need **mandatory AI impact statements**, requiring firms to disclose displacement risks and reskilling plans before deployment. We need **worker representation on corporate AI ethics boards**. And we must explore **platform cooperatives**, where workers own the data and algorithms that shape their labor.

Finally, **we must create good jobs where AI cannot—and should not—replace us**. The care economy, climate resilience, community education—these are sectors with **low automation risk and high social value**. A public job guarantee in elder care, for example, could employ millions while using AI as a tool—predicting health risks, not replacing human touch. As Mariana Mazzucato urges, let public investment **steer AI toward societal missions**, not just private profit.

Colleagues, this is not a technical problem. It is a **moral and political one**. AI will not “solve” unemployment. Markets will not “adjust.” Only **deliberate, democratic, and redistributive action** can ensure that the post-AI era is one of shared prosperity—not stratified precarity.

Let us not ask, “Can AI replace this job?”  
Let us ask, **“What kind of society do we want to build—and who gets to decide?”**

The answer must be: **all of us**.

Thank you.
