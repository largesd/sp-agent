**Honorable Chair, Distinguished Colleagues, Esteemed Audience,**

Over these three rounds, Mary has reminded us that dignity cannot be algorithmically optimized, and Peter has demonstrated that markets alone cannot orchestrate a just transition. I stand before you as someone who builds these systems, who deploys these tools, and who has seen firsthand how quickly the "future of work" becomes the present of unemployment. Today, I want to convince you that **the threat is not mass joblessness alone, but the "zombification" of work itself**—a state where humans remain employed but cognitively atrophied, trapped in "exception handling" roles that lead nowhere while AI erodes the very expertise that makes us valuable.

Mary speaks of worker power, and Peter of market signals. But I speak of **velocity**. The research is unambiguous: unlike the Industrial Revolution's 50-year "Engels Pause," AI deployment cycles compress disruption into 6-to-18-month windows. When Harvey AI deployed across 3,500 lawyers at Allen & Overy, it didn't just increase efficiency—it collapsed the apprenticeship pipeline. Junior associates now validate AI output without learning pattern recognition, creating what I call "competence cliffs." By year three, they lack the tacit knowledge to become senior partners, yet the billable hour model that funded their training has evaporated. This is not the "lump of labor" fallacy; this is **human capital destruction in real-time**.

Peter suggests we face a "mismatch" problem. I argue we face an **atrophy crisis**. As Dr. Arvind Narayanan observes, when we outsource reasoning to Large Language Models, we create cognitive dependence akin to GPS navigation's erosion of spatial awareness. In the Philippines, 1.3 million BPO workers haven't been fired—they've been deskilled, reduced to "exception handlers" for angry customers, earning 40% less than their predecessors with no path to Tier-2 technical roles because AI now handles the technical queries. They are employed but economically obsolete, a "useless class" of the cognitively dependent.

This is why I reject both Mary's purely labor-centric framework and Peter's gradualist adaptation. **We do not have time for gradualism.** When Nike attempted full automation with Speedfactory, they discovered that soft-material dexterity remains 10x more cost-effective with humans—but cognitive automation faces no such Moravec Paradox. AI threatens knowledge work across the skill spectrum simultaneously, breaking the traditional "escalator" up the labor market.

So how do we solve this? Not by resisting the technology, but by **restructuring the ownership and architecture of work itself**.

**First, we need Algorithmic Labor Rights with teeth.** Mary is correct that dignity requires power, but in AI-managed workplaces, power requires **transparency**. We must mandate "Right to Explanation" laws—expanding GDPR Article 22—so workers subject to algorithmic scheduling and performance monitoring understand the logic behind decisions. Uber drivers in the EU recently used algorithmic transparency to prove wage theft; this must become universal. Furthermore, we need "Human Override Mandates"—legal requirements for human judgment in high-stakes workflows and, crucially, **apprenticeship ratios** in AI-augmented professions. If Harvey AI increases lawyer productivity by 30%, the firm must maintain 1:1 human mentor-to-mentee ratios, preserving knowledge transfer even as AI handles document review.

**Second, we need ownership, not just UBI.** Peter's safety nets are necessary but insufficient. If AI generates $10 trillion in productivity gains while decoupling wages from output, we need **Sovereign Wealth Funds for AI**—public ownership stakes in AI platforms modeled on Alaska's Permanent Fund. Imagine a "technological dividend" funded by per-terabyte levies on commercial training data, distributing $2,000 annually to every citizen as equity, not charity. Combine this with Platform Cooperativism—worker-owned AI tools like the Driver's Seat Cooperative—ensuring productivity gains accrue to workers, not extractive platforms.

**Third, we must acknowledge the Global South dimension.** Peter's "directed adaptation" assumes developed economy infrastructure. But as the Philippines BPO crisis demonstrates, AI enables "virtual reshoring"—cognitive work returning to the North via AI while manufacturing remains automated, breaking the development ladder. We need **Place-Based Industrial Policy** for "AI Impact Zones"—cities where >15% of the workforce faces BPO/admin displacement. Federal investment must pivot these regions toward "human-AI hybrid" certifications: medical scribe AI oversight, legal AI validation, and care economy roles where human presence remains inelastic.

**Finally, we need Educational Restructuring for "Cognitive Endurance."** Finland's Phenomenon-Based Learning offers a model—teaching cross-disciplinary thinking that resists automation. We must train "Centaur" skills: human judgment augmented by AI, not replaced by it. This means subsidizing not just coding bootcamps but **analog prototyping, face-to-face negotiation, and complex problem-solving without digital aids**—the very capabilities that atrophy when we over-rely on AI.

Colleagues, the debate is not "jobs versus no jobs." It is **"ownership, agency, and dignity in an age of abundance."** We cannot out-legislate the technology, nor can we market-signal our way through temporal compression. We need institutional innovation that matches technical innovation in speed and scale.

The Industrial Revolution eventually created more jobs than it destroyed, but that required the GI Bill, massive educational investment, and a 50-year adjustment. We do not have 50 years. We have, at most, one business cycle. Let us use it not to build bigger safety nets for a broken system, but to **redesign the system itself**—so that when the machines think, humans own, learn, and thrive.

Thank you.
