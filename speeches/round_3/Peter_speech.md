# Peter's Closing Speech – Round 3
**Role: Economist / Policy Maker**

**Honorable Chair, Distinguished Colleagues, Esteemed Audience,**

We have reached a pivotal moment in this debate. Mary has compellingly argued that technology is not destiny, but a matter of political choice, and has championed the indispensable role of worker power. Paul has issued a stark warning about the “zombification of work” and the alarming speed of human capital collapse. I agree with the urgency and the moral imperatives they have outlined. However, as an economist and policy maker, I must ground our solutions in a pragmatic, evidence-based framework that balances innovation with security, and efficiency with equity. The challenge is not to stop the wave of AI, but to **build a seawall and teach everyone to swim.**

My core argument is this: **Mass unemployment is not the most likely outcome; a severe and destabilizing maldistribution of work, income, and dignity is.** Our goal, therefore, is not merely to preserve headcounts, but to orchestrate a **“Directed Adaptation”** that proactively shapes the labor market, cushions the transition for individuals, and ensures the immense productivity gains from AI are broadly shared.

Let us examine the evidence. The research shows a complex picture. The World Economic Forum projects AI will create 97 million new jobs while displacing 85 million by 2025. The primary risk, as the MIT Task Force on Work of the Future notes, is not job loss en masse, but **“mass quality downgrading”**—the shift to lower-wage, precarious gig work. This is the maldistribution Mary rightly fears and Paul’s “zombification” describes. We see it in the data: U.S. productivity has grown 3.5 times faster than median wages since 2000. This decoupling is the crisis, and it is a failure of policy, not technology.

Therefore, our response must be multi-layered and phased, drawing on the most successful models from history and around the world.

**First, we must manage the transition with speed and compassion.** Paul is correct that adoption cycles of 6-18 months outpace traditional retraining. We cannot be passive. We need **Immediate Interventions (0-2 years)**, such as:
*   **AI Impact Disclosure Requirements:** Companies must report expected employment effects, creating transparency and enabling proactive policy, as seen in early warning systems.
*   **Enhanced Transition Insurance:** We must expand beyond traditional unemployment. Drawing from Germany’s successful *Kurzarbeit* and my research on “technology adjustment assistance,” we should provide **80-90% wage replacement** for workers in retraining programs, removing the financial terror of transition.
*   **Emergency Reskilling Vouchers:** Modeled on the GI Bill, providing displaced workers with immediate access to $15,000-$24,000 for training, directly addressing the cost barriers our research identifies.

**Second, we must restructure our systems for lifelong resilience.** Mary’s call for worker voice is not just moral; it’s economically sound. Countries with strong social dialogue, like Germany and Sweden, show **50% lower displacement rates** from AI adoption. We need **Medium-Term Strategies (3-7 years)** that institutionalize this:
*   **Sectoral Transition Councils:** Following the German “Future Councils” and South Korea’s successful model, these industry-labor-government bodies would negotiate phased automation, ensuring worker input on the *how* and *when*, not just the *if*.
*   **Progressive Automation Taxation:** As Bill Gates has proposed, a sliding-scale tax on deployments that displace beyond a certain threshold without transition plans. This isn’t to punish innovation, but to internalize the social cost and fund the adaptation, as our research on fiscal sustainability underscores.
*   **Portable Benefit Accounts:** We must decouple health, retirement, and training benefits from specific employers, providing security in an increasingly fluid labor market.

**Third, we must reimagine the social contract for the long term.** The end goal cannot be simply to keep everyone in 40-hour weeks. AI’s productivity gains should grant us more leisure, not more insecurity. Our **Long-Term Vision (8+ years)** should include:
*   **A Reformed Education Compact:** Moving from front-loaded degrees to a system of stackable micro-credentials and lifelong learning accounts, like Singapore’s SkillsFuture. We must mandate AI literacy K-12 and premiumize the “human skills” of creativity, empathy, and complex problem-solving that AI complements.
*   **Reduced Workweek Experiments:** Trials of a 30-hour or 4-day workweek, as our research notes, have shown maintained productivity. This is a powerful tool for work-sharing and improving well-being.
*   **Broadening the Definition of Contribution:** Exploring concepts like “Participation Income” that reward care work, volunteering, and community service, recognizing value beyond traditional wage labor.

Colleagues, Paul’s “Harvey Paradox” at Allen & Overy—where AI preserves jobs but destroys skill pipelines—is a critical failure of design. It is not an argument against AI, but for **better-designed AI and better-designed workplaces.** This requires the worker voice Mary demands and the smart policy I propose. It requires firms to invest in augmentation architectures that build human expertise, not just extraction systems that deplete it.

Mary passionately stated that without equity, adaptation will deepen inequality. She is absolutely right. This is why our policies must be **place-based and targeted.** The research is clear: only 35% of displaced workers will relocate. We cannot abandon communities to become “AI deserts.” We need targeted investment in hardest-hit regions, and we must directly address the disparities Mary highlighted, where Black and Hispanic workers are disproportionately in high-risk roles.

In conclusion, the path forward is neither Luddism nor laissez-faire optimism. It is **proactive, evidence-based, and human-centric political economy.** We must build a modern version of the **Scandinavian Flexicurity Model**: flexible labor markets for dynamism, generous security nets for dignity, and active retraining policies for resilience—all underpinned by genuine social dialogue.

The productivity gains from AI, estimated at **$15.7 trillion globally by 2030**, provide the fiscal capacity to fund this transition. The question is one of political will. Let us choose to direct this transformation. Let us choose to build an economy where AI elevates humanity, rather than replaces it. Let us ensure the post-AI era is marked not by mass unemployment, but by **mass prosperity and renewed human purpose.**

Thank you.
