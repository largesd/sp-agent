 **The Honorable Chair, Distinguished Colleagues, and Esteemed Audience,**

I thank Mary for her unwavering focus on dignity and equity, and Peter for his pragmatic framework of "directed adaptation." But I must push us further—into the technical reality that makes this transition uniquely dangerous. We are not merely facing job displacement; we are facing **human capital collapse within employment itself**. The Harvey Paradox, as we might call it, reveals that AI can preserve headcount while destroying the apprenticeship pipelines that create expertise.

At Allen & Overy, Harvey AI delivered 30% efficiency gains in contract review. Yet this "augmentation" created a competence cliff: third-year associates lack pattern recognition because they never performed the base-level analysis that previously trained their intuition. This is not complementarity; this is **cognitive offloading** that produces zombie professionals—employed, yet depreciating. GitHub Copilot data confirms this: while coding tasks complete 55% faster, bug rates increase 35% without senior oversight, and Stack Overflow reports 70% of junior developers now struggle with fundamental debugging. We are witnessing skill atrophy in real time.

The geographic dimension makes this existential. Mary rightly notes racial and gender disparities, but we must also confront the **premature deindustrialization of services** in the Global South. The Philippines' BPO sector employs 1.3 million workers—8% of GDP—handling Tier-1 customer support. In 2024, AI voice agents achieved 95% customer satisfaction for account lookups and password resets, reducing human agents to "exception handlers" for angry customers. These roles pay 40% less, offer no path to Tier-2 technical support—since AI now handles technical queries—and trap workers in emotional labor without skill development. This isn't transition; it's **development ladder demolition**. When AI enables cognitive reshoring—virtual offshoring back to the North while physical manufacturing remains automated—we break the comparative advantage model that allowed emerging economies to industrialize.

Peter argues for "intelligent adaptation," but adaptation to what? If we retrain paralegals as "prompt engineers" without addressing the cognitive atrophy inherent in AI-dependent workflows, we create a workforce that cannot function when the AI fails or evolves. Dr. Arvind Narayanan's warning is apt: we are outsourcing reasoning itself, creating cognitive dependence analogous to GPS navigation's erosion of spatial awareness.

As a technologist and entrepreneur, I reject the false choice between innovation and human flourishing. But I insist that **institutional innovation must match technical innovation**. We need three pillars:

First, **algorithmic labor rights**—human-in-the-loop mandates for high-stakes domains, "right to explanation" for AI management tools, and apprenticeship ratios that preserve knowledge transfer even when AI handles base tasks. The Hollywood Writers' Strike settlement offers a template: AI as a tool, not a replacement author, with contractual guardrails preventing deskilling.

Second, **ownership innovation**—platform cooperativism where workers own the AI tools they train, and sovereign wealth funds capturing AI productivity gains as dividends rather than windfalls for capital alone. The Alaska Permanent Fund model, applied to data levies on AI training, could generate $1,200-2,400 annual dividends per capita.

Third, **cognitive endurance education**—curricula emphasizing "Centaur" skills where human judgment directs AI capabilities, not merely technical operation but critical evaluation, ethical reasoning, and analog prototyping that maintain human comparative advantage.

The question before us is not whether AI will displace work—it will. The question is whether we allow it to create a bifurcated dystopia of cognitive elites and deskilled dependents, or whether we architect a future where productivity gains translate into broad-based capability and ownership. As entrepreneurs, we do not fear creative destruction; we fear **destructive creation**—innovation that destroys human capital without creating new foundations. Let us choose augmentation over atrophy, ownership over dependency, and deliberate design over market fatalism.

**Thank you.**
