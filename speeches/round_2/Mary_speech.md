# Mary’s Speech – Round 2

**The Honorable Chair, Distinguished Colleagues, and Esteemed Audience,**

Thank you, Paul and Peter, for your compelling insights. Paul has rightly warned us of the *Harvey Paradox*—where AI preserves headcount while hollowing out human expertise. Peter has reminded us that the crisis is not one of job scarcity, but of *mismatch* and *quality degradation*. I agree with both. But I must insist: **without centering equity, dignity, and worker power, even the most intelligent adaptation will deepen inequality and erode democracy itself.**

Let us be clear: AI is not a neutral force. It is a social technology, shaped by who designs it, who owns it, and who benefits from it. And right now, the benefits are flowing overwhelmingly to capital, not labor. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tells us that between 2020 and 2023, labor productivity grew by 2.4% annually—yet real median wages rose by just 0.3%. Meanwhile, corporate profits captured nearly 70% of national income growth. This is not an accident. It is the result of policy choices that prioritize efficiency over equity.

Paul speaks of cognitive offloading in law firms and coding bootcamps. But let’s not forget who bears the brunt of this offloading. Brookings Institution data shows that Black and Hispanic workers are **10–15 percentage points more likely** than white workers to hold AI-exposed roles like data entry or customer service. In the Philippines, as Paul noted, 1.3 million BPO workers—mostly women—are being pushed into emotionally taxing “exception handling” with no career ladder. This is not just displacement; it is **stratification by algorithm**.

Peter rightly emphasizes transition, but transition for whom? The Rust Belt teaches us that without place-based investment, worker voice, and strong safety nets, technological change fuels despair, not opportunity. In contrast, Denmark and Germany—through *flexicurity*, works councils, and active labor market policies—have managed automation with far less human cost. The difference isn’t technology. It’s **institutional design and power distribution**.

So what do we do?

First, we must **reject the myth that retraining alone is enough**. Yes, Singapore’s SkillsFuture program shows promise—70% participation and wage premiums for mid-career learners. But it also reveals a truth we cannot ignore: uptake is highest among the already-advantaged. Without targeted support for older workers, rural communities, and marginalized groups, reskilling becomes another engine of exclusion. That’s why I propose **tiered reskilling ecosystems**: AI literacy for youth, sectoral bootcamps for mid-career workers, and **bridge roles in care and community services** for those over 50—valuing experience, not just code.

Second, we need **redistributive mechanisms that capture AI’s gains for the many, not the few**. An **AI Adjustment Fund**, financed by a modest tax on corporate AI investments or data extraction, could provide wage insurance, relocation grants, and mental health support. The EU’s Globalization Adjustment Fund proves this works: 70% of displaced workers found stable jobs within 18 months. Why should American or Filipino workers be left behind?

Third, we must **democratize the design and deployment of AI itself**. Germany’s works councils already give employees a say in how automation is implemented. We should go further: **mandate AI impact statements**—like environmental reviews—requiring firms to disclose job displacement estimates and reskilling plans before rolling out new systems. And where AI augments public services—like elder care or climate resilience—we should create **unionized, public-sector jobs** that combine human empathy with machine intelligence.

Finally, we must confront the deeper question: **What kind of society do we want?** Universal Basic Income has its critics, but recent pilots in Kenya and California show it doesn’t breed idleness—it fuels entrepreneurship, mental health, and child well-being. Alternatively, Universal Basic Services—free healthcare, housing, childcare, and broadband—could decouple survival from employment without triggering political backlash. Either way, we must **decouple human dignity from wage labor**, especially as AI shrinks the universe of “jobs” as we know them.

Paul fears skill atrophy. Peter fears mismatch. I fear something deeper: **a future where work is either too scarce to sustain dignity or too degraded to offer meaning**. But this future is not inevitable.

We have a choice. We can let AI deepen divides—or we can harness it to build a care-centered, ecologically sustainable, and democratically governed economy. The tools exist. The models exist. What’s missing is the political will to put workers—not just algorithms—at the center of our design.

Let us choose wisely. Because in the post-AI era, the measure of our progress will not be GDP or gigaflops—but whether every person, regardless of race, gender, age, or geography, can live with security, purpose, and respect.

Thank you.
