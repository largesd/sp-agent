## **Beyond Jobs: Reclaiming Work as a Social Good in the Age of AI**

Colleagues, Peter and Paul have offered compelling visions—one grounded in institutional scaffolding, the other in technological velocity. Both recognize the urgency of this moment. But as a sociologist and labor rights advocate, I must insist: **we cannot solve mass unemployment without confronting what work *means* in a just society**.

AI-driven displacement is not merely an economic glitch to be smoothed over with retraining vouchers or wage top-ups. It is a profound social rupture—one that threatens to sever the ties between labor, dignity, and belonging. If we treat this crisis as a technical problem alone, we risk engineering a future where the few own the means of intelligence, and the many are left with neither livelihood nor purpose.

Let us be clear: **technology does not determine destiny**. The path we take depends on the values we embed in our institutions. And right now, those values are skewed toward efficiency over equity, profit over people.

## **The Myth of Frictionless Transition**

Paul rightly notes the “fractal” nature of displacement—some sectors booming, others collapsing. But let us not mistake complexity for manageability. When generative AI slashes entry-level legal, writing, and design jobs by 60–70%, as recent platform data shows, it doesn’t just eliminate tasks—it **erases the on-ramps** into professions. How does a first-generation college graduate become a lawyer if AI does all the document review that once trained them? How does a young artist build a portfolio when AI floods the market with synthetic content?

Peter’s “Cushion, Catalyze, Connect” framework is thoughtful, but it assumes a labor market that is *open and permeable*. Yet our research shows that **retraining programs often fail mid-career workers**, especially women and minorities. The U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance program places fewer than half of participants in stable jobs. And even when new roles emerge—like “AI whisperers”—they require elite technical literacy, geographic mobility, and social capital that most displaced workers lack.

This isn’t a skills gap. It’s a **structural exclusion**.

## **Work Is More Than Wages—It’s Identity and Community**

Economists often reduce work to income. But sociology teaches us that work is a **primary source of identity, social connection, and civic participation**. When we lose our jobs—not just temporarily, but *permanently*, as AI renders entire occupational categories obsolete—we lose more than paychecks. We lose standing, routine, and a sense of contribution.

UBI pilots, like those in Finland and Stockton, show that cash transfers don’t significantly reduce employment—but they also don’t restore **meaning**. A universal check may prevent starvation, but it cannot replace the pride of teaching a child to read, caring for an aging parent, or building a community garden. These are not “jobs” in the narrow economic sense—they are **socially reproductive labor**, and they are precisely the kinds of human-centered work that AI cannot replicate.

That’s why we must shift from a **job-centric** model to a **work-centric** one—one that values all forms of socially necessary labor, paid or unpaid.

## **A Human-Centered Policy Agenda**

So what do we do? Drawing from our research and global experiments, I propose three non-negotiable pillars:

### **1. A Federal Job Guarantee for Socially Valuable Work**

Rather than hoping the private sector will organically create “good” jobs, the government must act as **employer of last resort**—not in warehouses or call centers, but in care, climate resilience, education, and community infrastructure. A job guarantee, as modeled by economists like Pavlina Tcherneva, would offer living wages, benefits, and dignity to anyone willing to contribute to the public good. These roles—elder companions, urban foresters, literacy tutors—are **high-touch, low-automatability, and desperately needed**.

### **2. Democratic Co-Governance of AI Deployment**

We cannot leave AI’s labor impact to corporate discretion. Just as we require environmental impact assessments, we must mandate **AI Displacement Impact Reviews** for any system that replaces human workers. More radically, we should embed **worker representatives in AI design teams**, as Germany does through co-determination laws. When workers help shape how AI is used, they can steer it toward **augmentation, not replacement**—exactly the “human-centered AI” Erik Brynjolfsson advocates.

### **3. Universal Basic Services—Not Just Income**

Cash alone cannot shield us from the commodification of survival. We must guarantee **universal access to healthcare, housing, childcare, education, and transit**—decoupling human well-being from wage labor entirely. This isn’t utopian; it’s pragmatic. As the OECD notes, countries with strong public services experience far less inequality during technological shocks. Basic services create the **foundation of security** that allows people to retrain, care for loved ones, or engage in civic life—without fear.

## **Rejecting the False Choice Between Innovation and Justice**

Paul warns of “startup speed.” Peter calls for “adaptive policy.” But we must reject the false dichotomy that pits innovation against equity. The real bottleneck isn’t speed—it’s **power**. Who decides which AI gets built? Who benefits from its productivity gains? Who bears its costs?

Kate Crawford’s research reminds us that AI’s harms fall heaviest on women, people of color, and low-wage workers. If we automate without redress, we don’t just risk unemployment—we risk **algorithmic apartheid**.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. Daron Acemoglu urges us to pursue “directional technological change”—AI that creates new tasks for humans, not just replaces old ones. That requires redirecting R&D incentives, taxing labor-displacing automation (as Bill Gates proposed), and investing in sectors where human judgment is irreplaceable: healing, teaching, creating, caring.

## **Conclusion: Building a Future Where Everyone Belongs**

Colleagues, we stand at a crossroads. One path leads to a world of unprecedented abundance—but only for the owners of algorithms. The other leads to a society that harnesses AI not to replace humans, but to **free us**—to care, to create, to connect.

The solution to mass unemployment isn’t just more jobs. It’s **more justice**. It’s recognizing that work is a social right, not a market privilege. And it’s building institutions that put people—not profit—at the center of the post-AI era.

Let us choose that future. Not because it’s easy—but because it’s right.
