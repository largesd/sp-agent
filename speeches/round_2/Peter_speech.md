# Peter's Speech - Round 2

**Role**: Economist / Policy Maker
**Model**: deepseek/deepseek-v3.2

**The Honorable Chair, Distinguished Colleagues, Esteemed Audience,**

I stand before you today not as an alarmist, nor as a techno-utopian, but as a pragmatic economist who believes that with foresight and deliberate policy, we can navigate this transition toward a more prosperous future. Mary speaks powerfully of human dignity, and Paul warns of the atrophy of capability. I hear you both. But I must argue that dignity is not preserved by resisting change, nor capability by clinging to obsolete tasks. Dignity and capability are secured by **orchestrating a just and productive transition**—one that harnesses AI’s immense potential to elevate living standards while protecting those it displaces.

My core thesis is this: **The primary challenge is not a net loss of jobs, but a painful and potentially destabilizing mismatch—in skills, in geography, and in timing.** Our policy response must therefore be as multifaceted and dynamic as the disruption itself. We must move beyond the binary debate of "stop AI" versus "let the market decide," and embrace a third way: **intelligent, evidence-based adaptation.**

### Reframing the Problem: From Mass Unemployment to Mass Transition

Let’s ground this in our shared research. Yes, Goldman Sachs estimates **300 million jobs** are exposed to automation. But the World Economic Forum also projects **97 million new roles** emerging. The historical record is clear: technological shifts do not destroy aggregate employment. They transform it. The real danger, as our updated research shows, is not a barren job landscape, but a **"quality downgrading"** of work, as the MIT Task Force notes, where displaced workers are funneled into lower-wage, less secure gig roles.

Consider the sectoral data. In healthcare, AI diagnostic tools have not made radiologists obsolete; they’ve **increased demand by 15%** as professionals shift to complex case management and patient consultation. In transportation, while autonomous vehicles may displace drivers, they simultaneously create new roles in remote operation, fleet management, and maintenance. The problem is not the absence of work, but the **chasm between the work that disappears and the work that appears**. This chasm is widened by three critical failures: a failure of skills investment, a failure of geographic mobility, and a failure of institutional speed.

### The Limits of Current Proposals and the Path Forward

I respect Mary’s call for worker power and Paul’s architectural warnings. But power without a plan is protest, and architecture without policy is just code. We need a concrete, phased, and integrated strategy. Let me outline what that entails, drawing on the most promising models from our research.

**First, we must manage the immediate shock with precision, not panic.** We need **AI Impact Disclosure Requirements**, mandating that companies of a certain size report expected employment effects of major implementations. This creates transparency. Coupled with this, we must modernize our safety net. We should expand **Unemployment Insurance** into **Transition Insurance**, providing 70-80% wage replacement for up to two years for workers in retraining programs for high-demand fields. This is not a handout; it is a social investment in stability, modeled on the success of Germany’s *Kurzarbeit* during the 2008 crisis.

**Second, we must aggressively bridge the skills gap.** The "train for what?" problem is real—65% of future jobs don’t yet exist. Therefore, our education system must pivot from teaching static knowledge to fostering **dynamic capability**. We must:
1.  Integrate **AI literacy and critical thinking** into curricula from K-12.
2.  Replace degree-focused pathways with **stackable micro-credentials** and **lifelong learning accounts**, like Singapore’s SkillsFuture model.
3.  Heavily subsidize reskilling for high-risk sectors, with a focus on the "human skills" that complement AI: creativity, empathy, complex problem-solving.

Our research shows retraining an average worker costs **$24,000**. This is a bargain compared to the social and economic cost of long-term unemployment. We must also be honest about demographic realities: workers over 50 have lower retraining completion rates. For them, we need robust **wage insurance** programs to subsidize transitions to new, potentially lower-paying roles, and we must value the mentorship and institutional knowledge they provide.

**Third, we must acknowledge that not all communities will win at the same time.** Only 35% of displaced workers are willing to relocate. Therefore, we need **place-based policies**. We should create "**Regional Transition Councils**"—bringing together local government, industry, labor, and educators—to develop customized economic diversification plans for areas facing concentrated disruption, much like the "Future Councils" in Germany.

**Finally, we must think long-term about the structure of work and prosperity.** If AI delivers the **$15.7 trillion in global productivity gains** PwC projects by 2030, we have a historic opportunity to redefine prosperity. We should pilot and study a **reduced workweek**—not as a job-sharing scheme born of scarcity, but as a dividend of productivity that enhances well-being. We should explore models of **broad-based capital ownership**, such as data dividend funds or employee ownership trusts, to ensure the wealth generated by AI is widely shared.

### Conclusion: A Call for Prudent Optimism and Collective Action

Colleagues, the data does not support a doomsday scenario of permanent mass unemployment. It supports a challenging, but manageable, scenario of **accelerated transition**. The question before us is not *if* we will adapt, but *how* and *for whose benefit*.

Paul’s "Harvey Paradox" is a vital caution: we must design AI to augment human judgment, not replace human understanding. Mary’s focus on equity is non-negotiable: we must ensure this transition does not exacerbate existing inequalities along racial, gender, or geographic lines.

My synthesis is the **"Scandinavian Flexicurity Model 2.0"**—an integrated approach combining flexible labor markets, generous transition security, and active retraining policies, all underpinned by strong social dialogue. This model balances the need for innovation with the imperative of worker protection.

We are not passive observers of this change. We are architects. Let us choose to build a bridge from the economy of today to the more abundant, more humane economy of tomorrow. Let us fund the transition, empower the workers, and share the gains. The goal is not merely to avoid unemployment, but to **orchestrate an elevation**—of skills, of wages, and of human potential.

Thank you.
